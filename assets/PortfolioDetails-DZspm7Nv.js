In the first phase, I led the UX/UI redesign of the entire website. I began with a full review of the site&#39;s architecture and usability, identifying multiple opportunities to improve how product categories and information were displayed. A primary goal was to reduce the number of clicks needed to find and customize a product, making the experience smoother and more intuitive. </p><p class="text-seven n4-color"> A major contribution was the design of a vertical navigation system that supports a wide range of product categories. This expandable/collapsible menu included category-specific icons to aid recognition and enhance user comprehension. </p><p class="text-seven n4-color"> Another critical area of improvement was the customization process, which was previously managed in a multi-step flow within the cart. I redesigned this experience by shifting the customization options—placement, decoration method, file uploads, etc.—to the product detail page, dynamically adapting fields based on item type and availability. This change allowed us to simplify the cart from 6 pages to a single, clear summary with essential purchase, delivery, and payment details. </p><p class="text-seven n4-color"> In the second phase, I transitioned into a Front-End Developer role, implementing the approved UI designs using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.
